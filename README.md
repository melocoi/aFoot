aFoot

This is my first script to use with a midi foot controller I built. 
The intent was to have a footpedal interface to control the norns
while my hands are busy with other instruments. In this case it is too drive 
an asynchronous softcut looping setup. 

The main take away here is the footie.lua file, which needs some house cleaning, but this is what can travel from script to script and add some foot control where needed.

This script has been used in the generation of the album <a href="https://ululo.bandcamp.com/album/iuvante" target="_blank">iuvante</a>
